# About me
Hello, my name is **Evan Harlan** and I am a sophomore at Mizzou. While attending the *University of Missouri*, I hope to get my bachelor of science in informational technology. I hope to pursue software development, graphic design and potentially social media. Down below is a link to one of my isntagram accounts that I have grossed a large sum of followers.
